        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            This isn’t just a Bucket List app, it’s where I test-drive PHP with Symfony and see what breaks (spoiler: a lot).
            Add dreams, track goals, and occasionally wonder why that controller refuses to cooperate.

            Building features, fixing bugs, and pretending it was “part of the plan” is half the fun.
            More than a to-do list, it’s a playground to learn, experiment, and push code that grows along with me.
